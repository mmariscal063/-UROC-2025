#FOR LOOP WITH RANGE, same as your note book just diff formatting, heavy emmphasis on the FOR statement
print("For Loop excercise, counting 1 to 10:")
for i in range(1,10): #creates loop that runs 10 times,
    print(f"Count: {i}")

print("\n" + "="*40 + "\n") #this just creates a border

#FOR LOOP WITH A LIST
print ("For Loop excercise with a list")
fruits = ["maracuya", "garambullo", "pitaya", "tuna", "chichituna"] #list of strings
print("My favorite fuits:")
for fruit in fruits: # loops through each item in the fruits list, calling each item 'fruit'
    print(" I like " + fruit) #prints each fruit name in a sentence
print("\n" + "â˜…"*40 + "\n")

# what is the correct way to declare a Python variable?
# answer: x = 5 (created a varibale with a numeric value of 5)

#THIS IS MY EDIT TO TEST COMMIT ON GITHUB
